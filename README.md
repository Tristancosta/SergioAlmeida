# Hi there! 😁

My name is Sérgio Almeida from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Front-End Developer since 2009 and currently I'm Tech Lead at [Juntos Somos Mais](https://juntossomosmais.com.br). I'm passionate about open source projects, so I've created some projects as [Front-end BR](https://github.com/frontendbr) and I've always loved to produce a lot of content during my career.

In my free time I like to play (and watch) soccer (⚽️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about life with a beer (🍺).

Would you like to find me?
